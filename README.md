[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## New Features Added
### This is the Advance version of the First Flutter Project tutorial from google codelab. But, with additional features like
- New WordPair `Button`: Instead of using "Next" button to create new "WordPair" we will be using this button instead.
- Previous `Button`: We can browse back in history "WordPair" to view or display it in the "BigCard" 
- Star `Icon`: Added star icon in `history List<>` to show that it is the newly added WordPair
    - Note: if new added `WordPair` clicked or tapped, it will activate `toggleFavorite` function that will show 2 Icons `star` and `favorite`, else will only have `favorite` icon
